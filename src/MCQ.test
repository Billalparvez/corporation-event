1. Write the correct answer from the following options and give an explanation (2-5 lines).
let greeting;
greetign = {};
console.log(greetign);
A: {}
B: ReferenceError: greetign is not defined
C: undefined
Answer: A,
Write your explanation here:
 a variable  is declared but not assigned a value.
  JavaScript is case-sensitive,As a result,
   greeting remains undefined,so  it will output an empty object {}

2. Write the correct answer from the following options and give an explanation (2-5 lines).
function sum(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

sum(1, "2");
A: NaN
B: TypeError
C: "12"
D: 3
Answer: C,
Write your explanation here:
we know that JavaScript attempts to perform type coercion 
and converts the number 1 into a string, 
then concatenates it with the string "2".
 As a result, you get the string "12" as the output

3. Write the correct answer from the following options and give an explanation (2-5 lines).
const food = ["🍕", "🍫", "🥑", "🍔"];
const info = { favoriteFood: food[0] };

info.favoriteFood = "🍝";

console.log(food);
A: ['🍕', '🍫', '🥑', '🍔']
B: ['🍝', '🍫', '🥑', '🍔']
C: ['🍝', '🍕', '🍫', '🥑', '🍔']
D: ReferenceError
Answer :A,
Write your explanation here:
the favoriteFood property is reassigned to "🍝". 
This reassignment does not affect the food array, 
so when you log food, it remains unchanged,
 and the output is ['🍕', '🍫', '🥑', '🍔'].

4. Write the correct answer from the following options and give an explanation (2-5 lines).
function sayHi(name) {
  return `Hi there, ${name}`;
}

console.log(sayHi());
A: Hi there,
B: Hi there, undefined
C: Hi there, null
D: ReferenceError
Answer D,
Write your explanation here:
 there is a parameter name that is expected when calling the function.
  However, when you call sayHi() without passing any arguments,
   it will result in a ReferenceError
    because the function expects an argument name, and you haven't provided one. 
  

5. Write the correct answer from the following options and give an explanation (2-5 lines).
let count = 0;
const nums = [0, 1, 2, 3];

nums.forEach((num) => {
  if (num) count += 1;
});

console.log(count);
A: 1
B: 2
C: 3
D: 4
Answer
Answer: C,
Write your explanation here:
The forEach method is used to iterate through the array and for each element.
Since the first element (0) is falsy, it's not counted,
 but the other three elements (1, 2, and 3) are truthy,
  so they are counted.
